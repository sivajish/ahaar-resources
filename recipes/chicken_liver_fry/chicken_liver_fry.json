It has an essential nutrient vitamin B12 which supports the production of red blood cell and prevent pernicious anemia.It keeps your thyroid healthy. It is an excellent source of protein that keeps your hair, nails, skin healthy. It promotes good eyesight as it contains vitamin A in the form of retinol, alpha and beta-carotene.
