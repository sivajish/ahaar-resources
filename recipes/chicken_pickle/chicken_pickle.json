  "preface": "I was surprised when my husband asked me to buy chicken pickle from the store, because, I had never heard this dish before. I searched in all possible stores but unable to find it. Later, I got yo know, this is a famous pickle in Andhra Pradesh. I wanted to see and taste this wonderful pickle that amazed him. I got that chance and not only I became a fan of this but also learnt to make one. And when I mention this dish to my friends, they are surprised as well to know that a pickle can be made of chicken. So now I am sharing this recipe with you. Thanks to Jyoti Aunt for being patient and teaching me the same.  This is an amazing pickle and you must try it soon.",
