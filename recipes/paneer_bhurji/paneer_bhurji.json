The milk should curdle completely. Keep stirring the milk during this step so the milk does not stick to bottom. Once entire milk has curdled, immediately drain the milk in muslin/cheese cloth. The white portion collected is Paneer. Wait till the water is drained completely. Take a plate and put the muslin cloth with curdled milk. On top of it, place a heavy plate. Let it sit for 45 mins. Remove the Paneer from cloth and is ready to use in your dish."
